# Literature Notes


<!-- Main content of my thoughts really -->

> [!NOTE]
>** Literature Notes** are written _in the context of the source_ they were inspired by. 
> Whereas [Permanent Notes](Permanent%20Notes.md) are written _in the context of your own ideas and interests_.  
>
> Literature Notes _only have one connection_, to the source they came from. While permanent notes can have many connections to individual notes, as part of multiple topics etc.

> [!QUOTE]
> Literature notes are the scribbles and reminders I jot down when I read, then these get discarded as I process the book. - [[Christian Tietze]]
