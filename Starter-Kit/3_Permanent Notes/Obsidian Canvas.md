# Obsidian Canvas

<!-- Main content of my thoughts really -->

> [!Note]
> **Canvas** is an Obsidian plugin which provides an infinite space to visualize and make sense of your ideas. Canvas allows to organize notes visually â€” an infinite space to research, brainstorm, diagram and lay out your ideas. Embed your notes alongside images, PDFs, videos, audio, and even fully interactive web pages.

Canvas is a tool for visual note-taking. Lay out notes and other resources on an infinite canvas and connect them with lines.

Visual note-taking allows you to use visual aspects, such as size and position, to make sense of your notes. Connect notes with lines and group related notes together to better understand the relationship between them.
