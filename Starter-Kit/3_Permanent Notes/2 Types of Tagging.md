# 2 Types of Tagging

![[IMG_0099.PNG|300]]

<!-- Main ideas of my sketchnote  -->

## Why using Tags for Zettelkasten

I’ve learned that tags are best thought of as specially designated search terms. 

I choose using tags for Zettelkasten with two different goals in mind:
- to build up an **index**
- to define **clusters**

Both methods of tagging support further searching:
- The terms in my **index** are leading me to **important entry points** in the slip-box.
- The terms which define **clusters** are leading me to **a number of similar notes that belong together**.

While **tags for indexing** should link only a few important notes, the entry points for further investigation, the **tags for clustering** connect larger groups of notes with similar focus.

### Comments

> You forgot a vital third use: tags that are never actually used for searching and only function as psychological reassurance that you’ll be able to find things again.  (I’ve reduced my use of these lately.)
